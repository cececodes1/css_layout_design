## Project Overview

This project focuses on building flexible and adaptive web layouts using **CSS Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** techniques. 
The goal is to design responsive webpages that adjust seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth and visually appealing user experience across devices. 
This project is divided into two parts: one using **CSS Flexbox** and the other using **CSS Grid** to create modern, responsive designs.

## Objectives

1. **Apply CSS Flexbox:** Use Flexbox properties to build a basic webpage layout with responsive design elements.
2. **Apply CSS Grid:** Create a web layout using CSS Grid and implement responsive behavior for various screen sizes.
3. **Enhance Design:** Improve the layout by adjusting Flexbox and Grid properties to ensure a well-structured, aesthetically pleasing page that works across all devices.

## Part 1: CSS Flexbox Layout

### Task 1: Basic Flexbox Layout

- **Header:** Contains a background image and centered, bold header text with contrasting color.
- **Navigation Menu:** Includes at least 3 items (e.g., Home, Profile, About), arranged horizontally.
- **Main Content:** Includes at least 2 vertically stacked content sections.
- **Footer:** Contains 3 horizontally arranged sections (e.g., Contact Us, Events, Blog).

**Expected Outcome:**  
A webpage featuring a basic Flexbox layout with header, navigation, main content, and footer.

### Task 2: Responsive Flexbox Design

- Use **media queries** to make the navigation and footer stack vertically on smaller screens (viewport width less than 600px).
  
**Expected Outcome:**  
The layout adjusts to smaller screens by stacking content vertically, while the header and footer span the full width.

### Task 3: Enhance with Flexbox Properties

- Utilize Flexbox properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-grow` to ensure proper spacing and alignment.
  
**Expected Outcome:**  
Main content expands to fill the space between the header and footer, and all content is centered and well-aligned for a balanced layout.

## Part 2: CSS Grid Layout

### Task 1: Basic CSS Grid Layout

- **Header:** Spans the full width of the page.
- **Main Content:** Divided into two columnsâ€”one for content and one for a sidebar.
- **Footer:** Spans the full width of the page.

**Expected Outcome:**  
A simple webpage layout using CSS Grid with a header, two-column main content, and a footer.

### Task 2: Responsive Grid Design

- Use **media queries** to make the grid layout adjust for smaller screens (width less than 768px), stacking the columns vertically.

**Expected Outcome:**  
The layout shifts to a single-column format on smaller screens, with the content and sidebar stacking vertically.

### Task 3: Advanced Grid Layout

- Use properties like `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` to refine the layout, ensuring the main content takes up more space than the sidebar on larger screens.

**Expected Outcome:**  
A refined grid layout with responsive adjustments for different screen sizes, ensuring a well-balanced and functional design.
